Team Name: POSINT Bellingkittens

Description: Following the exodus of Myanmar's mass Rohingya displacement in 2017, this project aims to find the correlation between the spread of hate speech on Twitter and the occurance of fires within the border regions of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Our data set consisted of Twitter posts tagged with the anti-Rohingya hashtags of #NoRohingya and #Bengaliterrorists, as well as data from NASA Firms Global Fire Map.
